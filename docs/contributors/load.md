# Load data into OpenSpending

It is possible to load Fiscal Data Packages into OpenSpending via a web app (the Packager) and via a CLI.

## Using the Packager

- [Code repo](https://github.com/openspending/os-packager)
- [Packager URL](https://openspending.org/packager)

The Packager provides a simple user interface to load data into OpenSpending. The app is a wizard that guides the user through the uploading of a data source, the modeling of a Fiscal Data Package, the provision of metadata, and publication to the OpenSpending Datastore.

## Using the CLI

- [Code repo](https://github.com/openspending/os-cli)
- [CLI docs](https://docs.openspending.org/en/latest/developers/cli/)

The CLI provides a simple command line interface to interact with an OpenSpending instance. Using the CLI, you can authenticate with an OpenSpending instance and then push data directly to the datastore.
