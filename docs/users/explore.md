# Exploring the data in OpenSpending

OpenSpending is a large and growing database of fiscal data. The way to discover what is in the database is via a web app we call the [Explorer](https://openspending.org/explorer). If you feel comfortable using tools like Google to search for information, and using standard web forms to enter data, then the Explorer should feel quite familiar.

## Walkthroughs

1. Access OS Explorer: https://openspending.org/explorer/.
